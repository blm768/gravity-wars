# Gravity Wars

This project is an attempt at a modern re-implementation of the classic game
[Gravity Wars](http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~doroshen/downloads/gwars.html)
using WebAssembly and WebGL. It's not currently in a playable state; the
graphics code is very much a work in progress, and the game logic is totally
unimplemented. Hopefully all of that will change before long.
